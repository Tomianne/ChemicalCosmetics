Curious about what goes into your favourite cosmetics? Ever thought about the sheer variety – over 12,000 chemicals – that can be found in your beauty products? This analysis is a fascinating dive into the world of cosmetics ingredients! This dataset uncovers the details: the chemical names, the brands in which they are found and the companies making them. You will also see when the chemicals were reported and if they were actually removed.

## About the Data
This dataset contains information on chemicals used in cosmetics, including the name of the chemical, the company that uses it, the category of cosmetics it is used in, and the date it was first reported. The data dictionary provides more information on what each column represents. To use this dataset, you can filter by primary category, subcategory, product name, or company name to find specific information on ingredients used in cosmetics products. You can also use the 'Chemical Count' column to see how many different chemicals are present in a product.
## Tools Used
The data was imported into Microsoft SSMS for cleaning and analysis. Visualization was done in Microsoft PowerBI. 
## The Analysis 
The Analysis aimed to answer the following questions. 
1. Find out which chemicals were used the most in cosmetics and personal care products.
2. Find out which companies used the most reported chemicals in their cosmetics and personal
care products.
3. Which brands had chemicals that were removed and discontinued?
4. Identify the brands that had chemicals which were mostly reported in 2018.
5. Identify the period between the creation of the removed chemicals and when they were actually
removed.
6. Can you tell if discontinued chemicals in bath products were removed? 
7. Identify the relationship between chemicals that were mostly recently reported and discontinued. (Does most recently reported chemicals equal discontinuation of such chemicals?)
8. Identify the relationship between CSF and chemicals used in the most manufactured subcategories. (Tip: Which chemicals gave a certain type of CSF in subcategories?)
## Visualization
The results of queries were imported as an Excel file into Microsoft PowerBI where visualization was done.
